All nav systems in Ocean City, NJ on iPhone and vehicles lose GPS signal for long periods of time and are off by miles.

Waze began malfunctioning and thought I was on some random side roads a good bit off to the side of 495 & began continually re-routing. Force restarted Waze, problem persisted. Had my passenger try switching to Apple Maps & it had the same issue, thought we were off on the side like Waze did. Thought it might just be my phone then so tried engaging my cars built in nav system and displayed the current gps location in the same inaccurate position as Waze was. At that point suspected it was not something with my phone but likely a broader GPS issue given it was happening across devices. Did not think it would help, but for the sake of trying, I powered my phone completely off since it was connected via CarPlay just to verify there was no possible way that my phone was somehow interfering with my card nav system (tho I don’t know how that would even happen anyway).

Upon departing Suez Canal, a loss of satellite connection caused both GPS units to fail. The vessel was equipped with 2 JRC JRL-7880 GPS units. Each unit is connected to its own antenna and can support all bridge equipment. Both units struggled to regain a fix while moving at 10 kts. The satellite display on the GPS contained 1-3 satellites instead of the average of 10. GPS positions arrived once every 3-5 minutes. The vessel safely navigated the next 30 miles using radar and intermittent GPS fixes. Loss of GPS Affected: •	AIS through the loss of Course Over Ground (COG) vector. •	ECDIS placed in deduced reckoning (DR) mode to maintain cross track distance and enable safety frame. •	Wheelhouse Alarm Panel (WAP) All-call activated. •	Radars with date, time & GPS input. •	Gyro compass Auto-Latitude input. The loss of signal at the mouth of the Suez Canal forced the Badlands Trader to proceed onwards. The bridge team worked together to escape the dense traffic. Upon emerging from traffic, priority shifted to diagnosing the source of GPS loss. While departing the Port Said Traffic Separation Scheme at 2200, 31-34.3N 032-11.7E, the Badlands Trader called the tanker Violando, IMO # 942985, on channel 16. Violando reported they had GPS problems as well. 5 other unnamed vessels joined in the radio call to confirm their GPS failures. By 0100 July 22nd, Lat 32-01.5N 031-35.6E, the crew optimized the GPS settings to latch onto the growing number of satellites. Both GPS units regained steady fixes. We attribute the loss of GPS to a local loss of signal. Maneuvering delayed the re-acquisition of signal until more satellites became available. Both GPS units continue to fix. The crew will perform position checks against radar ranges and bearings upon sight of land this evening. NAVCEN: The GPS Operations Center reviewed the GPS Constellation and Control Segment, there are no known anomalies that might affect GPS signal integrity at the time and vicinity of the reported problem. Space weather was reviewed and found unlikely to have impacted GPS performance. There were no authorized GPS tests in the area. No correlating reports from inter-agency partners.

Upon departing Suez Canal, a loss of satellite connection caused both GPS units to fail. The vessel was equipped with 2 JRC JRL-7880 GPS units. Each unit is connected to its own antenna and can support all bridge equipment. Both units struggled to regain a fix while moving at 10 kts. The satellite display on the GPS contained 1-3 satellites instead of the average of 10. GPS positions arrived once every 3-5 minutes. The vessel safely navigated the next 30 miles using radar and intermittent GPS fixes.

While we were on I-80, the reports were generally south of our location although there were some occasions where it was reported north (generally it seemed having trouble determining our exact latitude). Occasionally, the GPS would briefly report our current actual location and then it would drift off after a few minutes. The disruption lasted from 9pm PDT when we left Tahoma to 1am PDT when we arrived in San Francisco. It was the first time in years of using GPS nav systems that I observed any errors.

Our personal GNSS receiver still gave a GPS fix(satellite only), confirming the ship’s DGPS unit’s fix loss was not being caused due to satellite GPS signals but possibly due to jamming or scrambling of the differential signals. As both DGPS units were setup with “Auto” for most settings, this was changed to “GPS Only” mode to process only satellite signals & reject all SBAS & DGPS signals.

About a month ago, while leaving the fourth floor on my way to work, a disturbance with the outside deck doors, a group of people alterring the new changes made to the doors, a female who appeared in distress, racing towards the corner I just came from. One of who appeared to be a worker joined the elevator with me. Since then my electrical has been of constant talk of what appears to be that women. Removing security files as low as human health (CDC) range and internet security files. Due to tinnitus the ears are currently sensitive to electrical, so upon the disruption with the removal of files a quick gasp, ring, or clog of the body and brain show reaction.a feeling of hate coming from this women.

The problem is radio has went viral and no one wants to report the hearing of viral to accept the discrepancies of the error.

The problem seems worst at 1030 am till about 1 pm. Also on another site miles away where fixed position time was less but accuracy and repeatability were also degraded. All receivers were rebooted several times and firmware updates were checked to be current. These problems were consistent and unexplainable. It was like stepping back in time to GPS equipment a decade ago. Radio links were strong time delay showed a second. Only in the wide open did the receivers function as expected as far as time to fix but repeatability was still degraded. Lock in cluttered or wooded areas that we have repeatedly performed this past year were impossible with and we tried two different receivers that have performed amazingly well in the last 12 months. I tried turning off each GNSS constellation to see if that made a difference and I tried turning off one SV at a time to see if that made a difference. Nothing seemed to work.

09/16/2020 1600 EEST,Southern Gulf of Suez,Marine,"User: My guess is that we experienced GPS jamming. In March 2020, while in the ASRY shipyard, the Fairfax had two new GPS receivers installed; one Furuno, and one SAAB. The SAAB model receives both GPS and Glonass position signals, and sends both to the ECDIS. These positions are usually within 3 to 10 meters of each other - very accurate. Because we have experienced GPS jamming on this vessel, several times before, in Port Said and in the Suez Canal, we proactively made the SAAB GPS/Glonass receiver the Primary ECDIS position sensor, to help defeat any GPS jamming. It worked -- we never received alarms, or lost our ECDIS picture. Since the AIS has its own stand-alone GPS receiver, it makes sense that we would lose all AIS data during a GPS jamming event. The momentary loss of radar video could be explained as the ECDIS lost the GPS data, and switched to the Glonass position. Again, this is my own guess. If the problem had continued, I could have made the Furuno GPS the primary sensor, to see if we would experience the full experience of GPS jamming problems. I did not think of doing this until later, well after the problems disappeared.

06/02/2019 00:25 UTC,Oklahoma,Transportation,"User: Equipment on railroad locomotives is showing diminished position accuracy. Since June 2 across a fleet of several thousand locomotives in the US the positional accuracy is decreasing. This decrease is documented by lower average # of satellites received and higher HDOP values reported by the receiver. An alarm is generated by our system when the HDOP reported by the receiver in the GPGGA message stays above 2 for 10 minutes or more. While admittedly not completely accurate, this makes a convenient marker for diminished accuracy. This alarm was generated by 6 trains in Oklahoma June 2nd but has been seen from the east coast to the west coast in the days since. A similar by possibly not related issue occurred in the Midwest December 7 of 2018 with roughly 500 trains generating this error over the day. The alarms did not repeat until June 2nd. Previously this alarm was not seen in 2016-2018. In addition, the system can mark when the train passes certain surveyed locations along the track like a wayside signal. If the GPS location of the train is not within a certain distance from the surveyed location when passed, then another alarm is generated. This alarm was raised less than 5 times in the first 4 months of 2019 but has been raised 15-20 times in June so far. This appears to be another indication that the accuracy of the position fix has diminished. There have been no changes to the GPS receiver firmware in the last 2 – 3 years.

Note the [equipment] is a retail data logging ""puck"" being used in the aircraft for supplemental logging, not an air navigation application. The units log NMEA GPGGA sentences at 1 second intervals when a fix is available, but do not include the satellite count. Participating aircraft flew from Hayward, CA (HWD) to Bakersfield, CA (BFL) to Laughlin, NV (IFP). Units were powered on prior to takeoff and turned off after landing. During the first leg from HWD to BFL, all units operated properly on board the participating aircraft. During the second leg, from BFL to IFP, four units were powered on between approximately 2030Z and 2100Z in Bakersfield, CA. Despite being in what should have been a ""hot start"" mode, none achieved a GPS fix until 2200Z. The powerup time and time and position of first fix for the units were as follows: Powered at 2100Z ; fix at 220019Z N34-48 W116-58 near Barstow, CA Powered at 2045Z ; fix at 220025Z N35-16 W116-07 near Baker, CA Powered at 2104Z ; fix at 220048Z N34-41 W117-24 near Victorville, CA Powered at 2026Z ; fix at 221536Z N34-53 W115-11 near Goffs, CA The fact that three units achieved a fix within 30 seconds of each other, while being separated geographically, and with varying (and excessive) times since startup, seemed unusual. The aircraft were all at an altitude of approximately 7000feet MSL. A fifth [equipment] was mistakenly left powered up throughout the ground stop at BFL, and logged a complete track. No other GPS anomalies were reported by participants. A [different model GPS unit] that was powered up at Bakersfield in the same timeframe acquired a fix immediately. I am aware that GPS interference testing was being conducted at Twentynine Palms that day (Flight Advisory 29PALMS 19-01), with the affected area encompassing the entire route of flight from Bakersfield to Laughlin. However, the testing was scheduled to be completed at 1300Z. While this issue is likely to be a manufacturer specific glitch, I am reporting it to see if any external factors may have been involved.
