# GPS_analysis
Analysis of GPS interruption data in public domain. This is a project I do in my free time, using public datasets processed with JupyterLab on Github Codespaces. It is not related to my current or previous employers.

# License status of source data
At the time of writing, [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License. The [Navigation Center of the United States Coast Guard](https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/) does not have a copyright or license statement on their website. The data is scraped as 'fair use'.  This dictates the licensing of this repository as GPL, which is a license appropriate for software but compatible with the wikipedia license.

# Roadmap
Aims:
- Clean up data in a way that allows longer term trends, global year on year analysis.
- Extract enough detail so that the dataset can serve as labelling/ground truth for GPS interference detection work.
