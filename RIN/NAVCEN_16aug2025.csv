I opened my other phone that I have for work, which is an iPhone 16 Pro. I turned on the GPS and put in my destination and it began to do the same thing. I turned both of those phones off. I pulled over. And set the navigation system in my vehicle which is a 2022 Audi Q5 plug-in, hybrid, electric vehicle. It began to do the same thing. I called my wife and she was tracking my location on her phone. She was tracking me using my iPhone 16 Pro Max. According to what she could see, I was in a different place than where I actually was. Those details kept changing as well. At one point I was on Culver and university, and she was showing me at the John Wayne airport. I was finally able to find my destination by pulling over, putting in an address, and putting in a destination. I did not follow the GPS, but I followed the written directions to get to my location. I finally arrived at my destination sometime around 10:30 PM. I don’t see how this could have been my equipment because three completely separate devices with GPS trackers failed simultaneously. Two different telephones, which are on two different accounts, and an automobile that is a high-end luxury vehicle. There had to have been some sort of an anomaly in the area with the actual satellite, or through The Coast Guard, GPS navigation center.

710,07/18/2024,"Titusville, FL",Automobile,"USER: While driving to work from Maitland, FL to Titusville FL, I noticed my iPhone 12 Google Maps display going erratic and placing the receiver location symbol south of the 408 expressway into nearby neighborhoods. I rebooted the iPhone, restarted Google Maps, but the issue remained. I then switched to my 2022 Audi A5's native GPS navigation system and saw the same behavior with the car location showing the same as my iPhone. I rebooted my iPhone again but to no avail. I watched this behavior continue as I drove eastward on the 408 and then onto US Hwy 50 toward Titusville, FL. As I continued eastward, the drift to the south versus true position increased. As I crossed the Saint John's River on Hwy 50, the iPhone and Audi receivers showed my position to be south of the 428 Beach Line expressway in the swampy off-road areas approximately 6 miles away. As I approached my work location (Boeing building in Titusville, FL), I rebooted my iPhone again and it returned to normal service but my car's received stayed ""locked onto"" whatever interference signal was generating the drift even as I parked in the parking lot. The car receiver returned to normal service when I started the car and left work and around 7 PM. Both receivers showed normal operations the entire trip home to Maitland, FL. Note that I'm an electrical engineer having worked in Electromagnetic Effects and RF Communications fields for 35 years primarily at the Kennedy Space Center Electromagnetic Effects Laboratory and with the USAF Eastern Test Range Frequency Manager. Therefore, the behavior I noticed was very concerning that 2 receivers of different designs were seeing the same erratic behavior suggesting an outside interfering or spoofing source.

647,02/03/2024,,Other,"USER: This anomaly has been ongoing since approximately January 3, 2024, and occurs at and around the junction listed at the above lat and long. When I approached that junction, all of the active GPS devices started to shift off in the incorrect direction. Normally, around 30-40 degrees of deflection from the route of travel. This deflection generally continues to occur for approximately 3-5 miles after the anomaly begins, and then the GPS corrects back to the route of travel. This anomaly tends to occur between around 1100z to sunset (around 2300z). My Jeep Grand Cherokee's integrated GPS has a satellite details page, and all of the satellites have high signal strength and an ample number of satellites. Due to the consistency of the interference and its start and stop timing, my initial assumption was some sort of ground-based interference either as unintentionally generatorated RFI or intentional interference. I will happily provide screenshots from both my iPhone and photos of the details page from my car if requested.

Waze began malfunctioning and thought I was on some random side roads a good bit off to the side of 495 & began continually re-routing. Force restarted Waze, problem persisted. Had my passenger try switching to Apple Maps & it had the same issue, thought we were off on the side like Waze did. Thought it might just be my phone then so tried engaging my cars built in nav system and displayed the current gps location in the same inaccurate position as Waze was. At that point suspected it was not something with my phone but likely a broader GPS issue given it was happening across devices. Did not think it would help, but for the sake of trying, I powered my phone completely off since it was connected via CarPlay just to verify there was no possible way that my phone was somehow interfering with my card nav system (tho I don’t know how that would even happen anyway). My passenger took a picture of the cars nav system & Waze being simultaneously incorrect in the same spot. The issue persisted from 495 S through getting on 95 S until we were about 10 miles north of Fredericksburg.

As far as we can tell it is near completely random what is causing it- we are unsure what the issue is but it makes deliveries near impossible for some drivers as they need to use Scanner device as their navigation tool. Without this, they are unable to deliver or even scan in packages when they arrive, leading to a few issues. The scanners will lose signal, some restarting themselves due to lack of signal and others completely shutting off.

Upon departing Suez Canal, a loss of satellite connection caused both GPS units to fail. The vessel was equipped with 2 JRC JRL-7880 GPS units. Each unit is connected to its own antenna and can support all bridge equipment. Both units struggled to regain a fix while moving at 10 kts. The satellite display on the GPS contained 1-3 satellites instead of the average of 10. GPS positions arrived once every 3-5 minutes. The vessel safely navigated the next 30 miles using radar and intermittent GPS fixes. Loss of GPS Affected: • AIS through the loss of Course Over Ground (COG) vector. • ECDIS placed in deduced reckoning (DR) mode to maintain cross track distance and enable safety frame. • Wheelhouse Alarm Panel (WAP) All-call activated. • Radars with date, time & GPS input. • Gyro compass Auto-Latitude input. The loss of signal at the mouth of the Suez Canal forced the Badlands Trader to proceed onwards. The bridge team worked together to escape the dense traffic. Upon emerging from traffic, priority shifted to diagnosing the source of GPS loss. While departing the Port Said Traffic Separation Scheme at 2200, 31-34.3N 032-11.7E, the Badlands Trader called the tanker Violando, IMO # 942985, on channel 16. Violando reported they had GPS problems as well. 5 other unnamed vessels joined in the radio call to confirm their GPS failures. By 0100 July 22nd, Lat 32-01.5N 031-35.6E, the crew optimized the GPS settings to latch onto the growing number of satellites. Both GPS units regained steady fixes. We attribute the loss of GPS to a local loss of signal. Maneuvering delayed the re-acquisition of signal until more satellites became available. Both GPS units continue to fix. The crew will perform position checks against radar ranges and bearings upon sight of land this evening.

While we were on I-80, the reports were generally south of our location although there were some occasions where it was reported north (generally it seemed having trouble determining our exact latitude).

I called the dealer a few times and they said it has nothing to do with the dealership or auto. They said it is because it's being put on satellite and they are working at getting all the numbers set right. Corp. said that Aug. 12, 2022 is when it should be fixed. That date came and went and it's still not working. Can you please tell me when this all should be straightened out? If this is not the correct place I should be talking to, can you inform me of who I should be getting ahold of. Apparently they are switching from towers to satellite for the autos. Vehicles that were built before 2012 is what it affected. I would really appreciate some kind of a response. I know nothing about the date or time it occurred.

468,12/21/2021,Empire,Surveying,"USER: During the weeks of December 21 and 28, we had the time to fix was very long when there was even slight skyview clutter accuracy and repeatability were considerably degraded compared to anything done in the last 12 months. The problem seems worst at 1030 am till about 1 pm. Also on another site miles away where fixed position time was less but accuracy and repeatability were also degraded. All receivers were rebooted several times and firmware updates were checked to be current. These problems were consistent and unexplainable. It was like stepping back in time to GPS equipment a decade ago. Radio links were strong time delay showed a second. Only in the wide open did the receivers function as expected as far as time to fix but repeatability was still degraded. Lock in cluttered or wooded areas that we have repeatedly performed this past year were impossible with and we tried two different receivers that have performed amazingly well in the last 12 months. I tried turning off each GNSS constellation to see if that made a difference and I tried turning off one SV at a time to see if that made a difference. Nothing seemed to work. I also contacted the equipment rep and we went over all settings and he suggested I check firmware which we did. This problem exists on two separate systems working in two different areas about 30 miles apart. We even traded equipment one day, and the problems still existed. I have checked the Nanu reports and one sat was unusable till the 27th but we had the same problems after that. I am hoping this clears up but I am concerned.

For years, GPS has routed truckers onto E.Raccoon Valley Road from Old Raccoon Valley Road as a shortcut to Norris Freeway, state road 441. First, it is not a significant shortcut; only a few seconds difference if they had maintained their original heading. Second, and most importantly, when they try to turn south onto Norris Freeway from E.Raccoon Valley the result is always the same. The truck ends up blocking both lanes of traffic because it cannot make the turn and the trailer is sitting on its parking legs due to the elevation. The truck always has to be towed out of this position, blocking traffic for a couple of hours and because it is the midpoint of a fairly sharp curve, this is an accident waiting to happen.

322,09/16/2020,Southern Gulf of Suez,Marine,"User: My guess is that we experienced GPS jamming. In March 2020, while in the ASRY shipyard, the Fairfax had two new GPS receivers installed; one Furuno, and one SAAB. The SAAB model receives both GPS and Glonass position signals, and sends both to the ECDIS. These positions are usually within 3 to 10 meters of each other - very accurate. Because we have experienced GPS jamming on this vessel, several times before, in Port Said and in the Suez Canal, we proactively made the SAAB GPS/Glonass receiver the Primary ECDIS position sensor, to help defeat any GPS jamming. It worked -- we never received alarms, or lost our ECDIS picture. Since the AIS has its own stand-alone GPS receiver, it makes sense that we would lose all AIS data during a GPS jamming event. The momentary loss of radar video could be explained as the ECDIS lost the GPS data, and switched to the Glonass position. Again, this is my own guess. If the problem had continued, I could have made the Furuno GPS the primary sensor, to see if we would experience the full experience of GPS jamming problems. I did not think of doing this until later, well after the problems disappeared.

208,06/02/2019,Oklahoma,Transportation,"User: Equipment on railroad locomotives is showing diminished position accuracy. Since June 2 across a fleet of several thousand locomotives in the US the positional accuracy is decreasing. This decrease is documented by lower average # of satellites received and higher HDOP values reported by the receiver. An alarm is generated by our system when the HDOP reported by the receiver in the GPGGA message stays above 2 for 10 minutes or more. While admittedly not completely accurate, this makes a convenient marker for diminished accuracy. This alarm was generated by 6 trains in Oklahoma June 2nd but has been seen from the east coast to the west coast in the days since. A similar by possibly not related issue occurred in the Midwest December 7 of 2018 with roughly 500 trains generating this error over the day. The alarms did not repeat until June 2nd. Previously this alarm was not seen in 2016-2018. In addition, the system can mark when the train passes certain surveyed locations along the track like a wayside signal. If the GPS location of the train is not within a certain distance from the surveyed location when passed, then another alarm is generated. This alarm was raised less than 5 times in the first 4 months of 2019 but has been raised 15-20 times in June so far. This appears to be another indication that the accuracy of the position fix has diminished. There have been no changes to the GPS receiver firmware in the last 2 – 3 years. We have been unable to correlate this diminished accuracy to reported satellite outages. Further information in graphical or spreadsheet format is available.

They were then flown aboard private aircraft enroute to Laughlin, NV. Despite being in what should have been a ""hot start"" mode, none achieved a GPS fix until 2200Z. Of particular note, three of the units achieved lock within 30 seconds of each other, despite being separated geographically by almost 100 miles. This seemed to suggest an external factor may have been involved. Detail: Five [equipment] units (SiRF Star III chipset) were used to log positions of aircraft participating in an air rally event. Note the [equipment] is a retail data logging ""puck"" being used in the aircraft for supplemental logging, not an air navigation application. The units log NMEA GPGGA sentences at 1 second intervals when a fix is available, but do not include the satellite count. Participating aircraft flew from Hayward, CA (HWD) to Bakersfield, CA (BFL) to Laughlin, NV (IFP). Units were powered on prior to takeoff and turned off after landing. During the first leg from HWD to BFL, all units operated properly on board the participating aircraft. During the second leg, from BFL to IFP, four units were powered on between approximately 2030Z and 2100Z in Bakersfield, CA. Despite being in what should have been a ""hot start"" mode, none achieved a GPS fix until 2200Z. The powerup time and time and position of first fix for the units were as follows: Powered at 2100Z ; fix at 220019Z N34-48 W116-58 near Barstow, CA Powered at 2045Z ; fix at 220025Z N35-16 W116-07 near Baker, CA Powered at 2104Z ; fix at 220048Z N34-41 W117-24 near Victorville, CA Powered at 2026Z ; fix at 221536Z N34-53 W115-11 near Goffs, CA The fact that three units achieved a fix within 30 seconds of each other, while being separated geographically, and with varying (and excessive) times since startup, seemed unusual. The aircraft were all at an altitude of approximately 7000feet MSL. A fifth [equipment] was mistakenly left powered up throughout the ground stop at BFL, and logged a complete track. No other GPS anomalies were reported by participants. A [different model GPS unit] that was powered up at Bakersfield in the same timeframe acquired a fix immediately. I am aware that GPS interference testing was being conducted at Twentynine Palms that day (Flight Advisory 29PALMS 19-01), with the affected area encompassing the entire route of flight from Bakersfield to Laughlin. However, the testing was scheduled to be completed at 1300Z. While this issue is likely to be a manufacturer specific glitch, I am reporting it to see if any external factors may have been involved.

218,02/01/2019,Global,Surveying,"User: Thanks to Navigation and Timing Monitoring Facility. Since the begining of February we received several NANU reporting unscheduled outages of a few minutes for some GPS satellites. NANU 2019020, 2019026, 2019085, 2019086, 2019091, 2019093, and 2019095. For each NANU we analyzed rinex navigation and measurement files from stations in visibility of the satellites. In every case the satellites were healthy according to their broadcast ephemeris data. We never saw any measurement gap bias or drift that could be linked to a clock problem and we could not see any power drop. When the satellites were monitored by a SBAS we did not see any problem with the satellites. Could you confirm the nature of the outage and the impact on the receivers? We would like to know our receivers behaved. As for the SBAS it is important to know if they have sent correct information. SBAS users could have used the satellites despite the outages and it could have led to a potentially hazardous situation. If you need additional information concerning our analysis please feel free to contact us.

NAVCEN: The GPS Operations Center reviewed the GPS Constellation and Control Segment and determined it to be healthy, stable and robust during that time. It continues to provide precise positioning navigation and timing information to military and civilian users around the world.

Although our engineers tried to be very careful in preparation of ROM code release for GPS chipset implementation, checking various test scenarios using GPS simulator, we still missed an issue in applying the 2 MSBs of IODC. This and recent change of those 2 MSBs becoming non-zero value caused about 2 million units of GPS receivers worldwide that worked perfectly for many years now suddenly have potential problem of unable to get position fix, we are beginning to get many customer problem reports coming in this week. May I ask if this IODC parameter will be set to a number < 256 again? And could the two MSBs of IODC be set to zero again as soon as possible please? Thank you very much.

NAVCEN: We have contacted the GPS Operations Center and they have informed us that: “After a recent ground system software update, we received reports of some users experiencing negative issues. As a result, we re-verified that our software update was indeed in complete compliance with IS-GPS-200 standards. Nonetheless, in order to continue to support all of our users to the maximum extent possible, we rolled back the software update to a previous version so that we can take the time to consult with the affected receiver manufacturer and proceed forward in a way to ensure dependable access to GPS for all users. In this case, as always, Air Force officials continue to work with their counterparts in the U.S. Coast Guard to analyze and respond to all user concerns.”

NAVCEN: 5 January 2017 the Civil GPS Service Interface Committee Executive Secretariat release the following message: Beginning 25 January 2017, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) will conduct a limited duration test implementing an increase of the L1 C/A power level on the GPS Block IIR-M and IIF satellites (19 vehicles). The C/A power will remain within IS-GPS-200-H specifications and the power increase is not expected to increase the noise floor by more than 0.3 signal-to-noise ratio in the worst case. AFSPC reports, ""We assess that there will be no adverse impacts to civil, commercial or military GPS users, but anyone who experiences issues during this test should address them through established reporting channels."" Civil, non-aviation, GPS users should contact the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center at 703-313-5900 or online at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gpsUserInput. Civil aviation GPS users should contact the FAA and file a report at https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas/gps_reports/.
