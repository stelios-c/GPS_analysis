Upon departing Suez Canal, a loss of satellite connection caused both GPS units to fail. The vessel was equipped with 2 JRC JRL-7880 GPS units. Each unit is connected to its own antenna and can support all bridge equipment. Both units struggled to regain a fix while moving at 10 kts. The satellite display on the GPS contained 1-3 satellites instead of the average of 10. GPS positions arrived once every 3-5 minutes. The vessel safely navigated the next 30 miles using radar and intermittent GPS fixes. Loss of GPS Affected: • AIS through the loss of Course Over Ground (COG) vector. • ECDIS placed in deduced reckoning (DR) mode to maintain cross track distance and enable safety frame. • Wheelhouse Alarm Panel (WAP) All-call activated. • Radars with date, time & GPS input. • Gyro compass Auto-Latitude input. The loss of signal at the mouth of the Suez Canal forced the Badlands Trader to proceed onwards. The bridge team worked together to escape the dense traffic. Upon emerging from traffic, priority shifted to diagnosing the source of GPS loss. While departing the Port Said Traffic Separation Scheme at 2200, 31-34.3N 032-11.7E, the Badlands Trader called the tanker Violando, IMO # 942985, on channel 16. Violando reported they had GPS problems as well. 5 other unnamed vessels joined in the radio call to confirm their GPS failures. By 0100 July 22nd, Lat 32-01.5N 031-35.6E, the crew optimized the GPS settings to latch onto the growing number of satellites. Both GPS units regained steady fixes. We attribute the loss of GPS to a local loss of signal. Maneuvering delayed the re-acquisition of signal until more satellites became available. Both GPS units continue to fix. The crew will perform position checks against radar ranges and bearings upon sight of land this evening.

Both GPS receivers were alarming, indicating a “loss of signal.” I switched GPS #2 to primary, because it also receives position data from GLONASS. This allowed our ECDIS to continue to function.

457,322,09/16/2020,Southern Gulf of Suez,Marine,"User: My guess is that we experienced GPS jamming. In March 2020, while in the ASRY shipyard, the Fairfax had two new GPS receivers installed; one Furuno, and one SAAB. The SAAB model receives both GPS and Glonass position signals, and sends both to the ECDIS. These positions are usually within 3 to 10 meters of each other - very accurate. Because we have experienced GPS jamming on this vessel, several times before, in Port Said and in the Suez Canal, we proactively made the SAAB GPS/Glonass receiver the Primary ECDIS position sensor, to help defeat any GPS jamming. It worked -- we never received alarms, or lost our ECDIS picture. Since the AIS has its own stand-alone GPS receiver, it makes sense that we would lose all AIS data during a GPS jamming event. The momentary loss of radar video could be explained as the ECDIS lost the GPS data, and switched to the Glonass position. Again, this is my own guess. If the problem had continued, I could have made the Furuno GPS the primary sensor, to see if we would experience the full experience of GPS jamming problems. I did not think of doing this until later, well after the problems disappeared.

538,220,07/16/2019,Port of Shanghai,Marine,"User: Upon arriving to dock in Shanghai, a U.S. flagged MV master checked ECDIS at the AIS to see if their berth was clear. Another ship on the berth appeared to be in the channel making 7 knots (kts) speed over ground (SOG), but then disappeared from AIS. A few minutes later she was back and at the dock, then underway again, 5 kts, 2 kts, 0 kts, in the channel, then back at the dock, then gone. This pattern repeated multiple times. It turned out the other ship was actually all fast the entire time. Later, while the MV was turning in the river off the same berth, both GPS units lost their signals, no position, no SOG, multiple alarms on various integrated equipment. The GPS signal would come back for a minute and then be lost again. This continued to the dock and has continued. The GMDSS GPS is experiencing the same thing. Master suspects GPS signal jamming is occurring at this berth. Vessel checked all antennae connections – all connections are secured and dry. There have been no other issues with these units.
