09/16/2020 1600 EEST,Southern Gulf of Suez,Marine,"User: My guess is that we experienced GPS jamming. In March 2020, while in the ASRY shipyard, the Fairfax had two new GPS receivers installed; one Furuno, and one SAAB. The SAAB model receives both GPS and Glonass position signals, and sends both to the ECDIS. These positions are usually within 3 to 10 meters of each other - very accurate. Because we have experienced GPS jamming on this vessel, several times before, in Port Said and in the Suez Canal, we proactively made the SAAB GPS/Glonass receiver the Primary ECDIS position sensor, to help defeat any GPS jamming. It worked -- we never received alarms, or lost our ECDIS picture. Since the AIS has its own stand-alone GPS receiver, it makes sense that we would lose all AIS data during a GPS jamming event. The momentary loss of radar video could be explained as the ECDIS lost the GPS data, and switched to the Glonass position. Again, this is my own guess. If the problem had continued, I could have made the Furuno GPS the primary sensor, to see if we would experience the full experience of GPS jamming problems. I did not think of doing this until later, well after the problems disappeared.

06/02/2019 00:25 UTC,Oklahoma,Transportation,"User: Equipment on railroad locomotives is showing diminished position accuracy. Since June 2 across a fleet of several thousand locomotives in the US the positional accuracy is decreasing. This decrease is documented by lower average # of satellites received and higher HDOP values reported by the receiver. An alarm is generated by our system when the HDOP reported by the receiver in the GPGGA message stays above 2 for 10 minutes or more. While admittedly not completely accurate, this makes a convenient marker for diminished accuracy. This alarm was generated by 6 trains in Oklahoma June 2nd but has been seen from the east coast to the west coast in the days since. A similar by possibly not related issue occurred in the Midwest December 7 of 2018 with roughly 500 trains generating this error over the day. The alarms did not repeat until June 2nd. Previously this alarm was not seen in 2016-2018. In addition, the system can mark when the train passes certain surveyed locations along the track like a wayside signal. If the GPS location of the train is not within a certain distance from the surveyed location when passed, then another alarm is generated. This alarm was raised less than 5 times in the first 4 months of 2019 but has been raised 15-20 times in June so far. This appears to be another indication that the accuracy of the position fix has diminished. There have been no changes to the GPS receiver firmware in the last 2 – 3 years. We have been unable to correlate this diminished accuracy to reported satellite outages. Further information in graphical or spreadsheet format is available.

They were then flown aboard private aircraft enroute to Laughlin, NV. Despite being in what should have been a ""hot start"" mode, none achieved a GPS fix until 2200Z. Of particular note, three of the units achieved lock within 30 seconds of each other, despite being separated geographically by almost 100 miles. This seemed to suggest an external factor may have been involved. Detail: Five [equipment] units (SiRF Star III chipset) were used to log positions of aircraft participating in an air rally event. Note the [equipment] is a retail data logging ""puck"" being used in the aircraft for supplemental logging, not an air navigation application. The units log NMEA GPGGA sentences at 1 second intervals when a fix is available, but do not include the satellite count. Participating aircraft flew from Hayward, CA (HWD) to Bakersfield, CA (BFL) to Laughlin, NV (IFP). Units were powered on prior to takeoff and turned off after landing. During the first leg from HWD to BFL, all units operated properly on board the participating aircraft. During the second leg, from BFL to IFP, four units were powered on between approximately 2030Z and 2100Z in Bakersfield, CA. Despite being in what should have been a ""hot start"" mode, none achieved a GPS fix until 2200Z. The powerup time and time and position of first fix for the units were as follows: Powered at 2100Z ; fix at 220019Z N34-48 W116-58 near Barstow, CA Powered at 2045Z ; fix at 220025Z N35-16 W116-07 near Baker, CA Powered at 2104Z ; fix at 220048Z N34-41 W117-24 near Victorville, CA Powered at 2026Z ; fix at 221536Z N34-53 W115-11 near Goffs, CA The fact that three units achieved a fix within 30 seconds of each other, while being separated geographically, and with varying (and excessive) times since startup, seemed unusual. The aircraft were all at an altitude of approximately 7000feet MSL. A fifth [equipment] was mistakenly left powered up throughout the ground stop at BFL, and logged a complete track. No other GPS anomalies were reported by participants. A [different model GPS unit] that was powered up at Bakersfield in the same timeframe acquired a fix immediately.

Since the begining of February we received several NANU reporting unscheduled outages of a few minutes for some GPS satellites. NANU 2019020, 2019026, 2019085, 2019086, 2019091, 2019093, and 2019095. For each NANU we analyzed rinex navigation and measurement files from stations in visibility of the satellites. In every case the satellites were healthy according to their broadcast ephemeris data.

When the satellites were monitored by a SBAS we did not see any problem with the satellites. Could you confirm the nature of the outage and the impact on the receivers?

There seemed to be GPS signal interference resulting in loss of signal, missing COG / SOG and absence of GPS signals affecting bridge navigation and other communication equipment. GPS screen showing no available satellites in the vicinity, no Lat/Long could be obtained. GPSs restarted - no effect. Pilot advised that tugs reported absence of GPS signal as well. After vessel was cast off situation remained unchanged so own position was obtained by visual and radar observations and frequently plotted in ECDIS as manual fix position. ECDIS was turned to Dead Reckoning mode. Approximately 10 nm away from port area both GPS recovered the signal. After calling few nearby vessels by VHF found out that GPS signal loss problem was common in this area. Also experienced that on private smartphones (verified by Master and 2/Off) it was impossible to obtain GPS position, the signal was not available.
